<p>The World Health Organization recognises the importance of green spaces in urban areas for physical activity: ‘Urban parks 
gardens provide routes for walking and cycling for transport purposes as well as sites for physical activity, social interaction and for recreation’
 .In developed countries, parks afford children the opportunity to be physically active: grassy areas provide space to run and throw, courts and 
ovals mark the boundary for sports (Australian rules football, cricket, soccer etc.), and playground apparatus facilitate climbing, sliding and swinging . 
Analysis of children’s park use shows that parks are used for sedentary, light, and moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activities (MVPA) during
 evenings on weekdays and on weekends. <br>
